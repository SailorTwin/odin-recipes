    <li>Place loaves, seam-side down, onto the cutting board; cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Beat egg and 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl; brush over risen loaves.</li>
    <li>Use a sharp knife to quickly cut one long slash down the center of each loaf.</li>
    <li>Gently shake the cutting board to make sure the loaves are not sticking; use a spatula or pastry knife to loosen them if necessary. Slide loaves onto a baking sheet with a quick but careful motion.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
